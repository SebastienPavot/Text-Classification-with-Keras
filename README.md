# Classify Covid-19 Tweets related using Keras

Using Python, Keras library and Streamlit, the goal was to analyze tweets related to Covid-19 and to classify them into 3 categories. For this, we used different type of Deep Learning models and try differents architectures in order to analyze the performance of each type. The second part of this project was to create a Streamlit App where we can display the results and let the user dig into each model or have a global overview of the performances.

**Bellow is a screenshot of the application which is available at the following link:**



*Note: Models can be a lot improved and preprocessing too, it was a learning based approach to understand better deep learning models and analyze which type work the best for text classification.
